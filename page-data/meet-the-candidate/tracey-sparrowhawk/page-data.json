She earned political experience by participating in previous electoral campaigns and is very excited about Maxime Bernier’s vision for Canada and his values based on Fairness, Equality, Personal Responsibility and Respect. </p>\n<p>Schick Sparrowhawk wants to take responsibility for representing average Canadians that are not being heard by the Canadian federal government; a spokesperson for those who have no voice.  As someone who looks for the good in people, appreciates each person’s unique strengths, and truly cares for everyone, her mission is to build bridges on common ground.</p>\n<p>Schick Sparrowhawk grew up on a farm near Esterhazy, Sask. Today, she and her husband Conrad have been married for more than 20 years and, together, have four daughters: Lysaundra (19), Macy (17), Shaylene (15) and Wynelle (13).</p>\n<p>In 1995, she earned her Master’s of Science degree with a major in Audiology from Minot State University. From there, she moved to Ontario to start her career with two different hearing aid manufacturers. After a decade in Ontario, she returned home to Regina with her family in 2006.  She currently works for a private hearing clinic. </p>\n<p>Schick Sparrowhawk has been invited to speak at various service clubs, personal care homes and has appeared on television to bring awareness of the importance of hearing health through properly fitted advanced technology hearing aids.</p>\n<p>Driven by her talents of congeniality, consensus-seeking and communication, she gets much joy from working alongside others. This has led to memberships in various organizations and boards including Rotary International, Regina Pro-Life Board of Directors, Saskatchewan Association of Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists Board of Directors, and The St. Peter Parent-Teacher Board. </p>\n<p>Schick Sparrowhawk is also an active member in her church and participates in various community events, such as the Regina Dragonboat Festival, coaching youth soccer for Regina North Zone and community outreach projects.</p>\n<p>Tracey decided to run as a candidate to represent the Federal Electoral District of Regina Qu’Appelle because she is very concerned about the future direction of Canada’s governance and its repercussions on everyday Canadians.</p>\n<p>“Canada is at a cross roads in our history,” she said. “Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada is the only party that will represent Canada first with true conservative values.”</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Donations</h1>\n<p>Etransfers accepted via email: donate@regina-quappelle.com</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://paypal.me/reginaquappelle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PayPal donations can be made here.</a></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Contribution</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tax Credit</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Actual Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$20.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$15.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$5.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$50.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$37.50</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$12.50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$100.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$75.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$25.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$250.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$187.50</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$62.50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$400.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$300.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$100.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$500.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$350.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$150.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,000.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$558.33</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$441.67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$1,600.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$650.00</td>\n<td align=\"center\">$950.00</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Legal limits on contributions to federal political parties:</strong>\nLegal limits on contributions to federal political parties:\nPlease note that in 2019, you are allowed to donate up to $1600 to the People’s Party of Canada.
