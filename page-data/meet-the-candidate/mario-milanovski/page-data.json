Although too young to make a serious contribution to his country, his interest in the administration of government did not subside. He saw – first-hand – the damage poor leadership and policy can do to a society.</p>\n<p>Milanovski immigrated to Moose Jaw, Sask. in 1998 where he and his wife Teodora settled with daughters Ekatarina and Ana. For the next decade, the couple worked to secure a better future for their family. Milanovski held two jobs and immersed himself in the culture of his new home. It is here he learned about the Canada not taught in books.</p>\n<p>While in Moose Jaw, he obtained a Business Administration certificate and Computer Information Systems diploma at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (Saskatchewan Polytechnic). The family then moved to Regina, where Mario continued Computer Science studies at the University of Regina. During summer break he worked for the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP), and educated himself on immigration programs.</p>\n<p>In 2009, the Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations (SAHO) offered Milanovski employment as HRMS Support Specialist. He quit his studies at the U. of R. and pursued the IT industry career opportunity.</p>\n<p>As he’s tended to his family and worked over the past several years, Milanovski has seen what he believes is trouble on Canada’s political landscape. This moved him to join Maxime Bernier and the People’s Party of Canada.</p>\n<p>“If you want to make changes you must get involved. I am determined to be part of that change,” Milanovski said about his candidacy in the next federal election. “The PPC platform is aligned with my beliefs and Canada is overdue for change. That change must include common sense, and the PPC platform is just that.”</p>\n<p>Legal limits on contributions to federal political parties:\nPlease note that in 2019, you are allowed to donate up to $1600 to the People’s Party of Canada.
